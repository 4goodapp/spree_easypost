# Spree + EasyPost

This is an extension to integrate Easy Post into Spree. This extension is based off of a combination of [solidus_easypost](https://github.com/solidusio-contrib/solidus_easypost) and [solidus_shipping_labeler](https://github.com/solidusio-contrib/solidus_shipping_labeler)

You will need to [sign up for an account](https://www.easypost.com/) to use this extension.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_easypost', github: 'ShopFelixGray/spree_easypost'
  ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_easypost:install
  rake db:migrate
  ```

4. This goes into a new file called `config/initializers/easy_post.rb`:
  ```ruby
  EasyPost.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  ```

5. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_easypost/factories'
```
